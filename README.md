## Features

🌟 Users can select any charity for donation and access comprehensive information about the chosen charity by clicking on its card.

🔎 Users can search for charities by category to easily find their desired charity for donation.

📜 In the donation page, users can track how many charities they have contributed to and see their donation history.

✉️ When users make a donation to a charity, they will receive a confirmation message. If a previously selected charity is chosen again, an error message will be displayed to prevent duplicate donations.

📊 Users can monitor their donation progress and see the percentage of their donations compared to the total donation in the Statistics page.

🖥️ The website is responsive, ensuring users can access and track their donation status seamlessly on their laptops, desktops, Android devices, and tablets.
